# Foreword

I often engage on side projects to design tools, frameworks, and methods to improve my productivity. Ironically, I spend alot of time on these side projects in lieu of actual work. 

Recently, I have come into the bad habit of mindlessly watching a lot of YouTube. Don't get me wrong, YouTube is a wonderful tool for learning and sharing the joy of funny videos. But, it is also an addictive drug, with vast quantities of garbage, waiting for my tired brain to go into low power mode and consume for far longer than I'd like.

The purpose of this side project is to try and "swat" YouTube away. If it comes on screen due to a brief lapse, **swat** it down.

# YouTube Swatter
To use, run this in your terminal with Python 3.7
```
py ./predict.py
```

Thats it!
